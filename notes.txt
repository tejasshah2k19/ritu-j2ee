when user submit html page using  form =>  


facebook.com -> Signup.html -> user fill data -> submit -> request -> server { accept } 

server -> read data -> some logic -> process ->   response { valid response | inValid response } 



server always accept request from user 
and 
server always give response to the user 

   request response life cycle -> 
   
   
   user -> request -> server -> response -> user 
   
   
   resource ? request process -> j2ee -> advjava --> servlet 
   
   SERVLET 
   
   how to create servlet ? 
   
   class A extends HttpServlet 
   
   
   1) extends HttpServlet 
   2) logic -> override -> service() 
   3) mapping -> url pattern
   
   
 how to add servlet-api.jar 
 	1) tomcat-lib directory 
 	2) web  { download } 
   
   http-> hyper text transfer protocol -> website -> www 
   
   
   
   if you create 10 servlet then you must have to follow above steps 10 times 
   		web.xml has all 10 servlet mapping

we have validation login in servlet - java file 
we set error variable in java file - servlet 

we need to print those error on signup page , which an html file 

can html read java variable - error ? no html does not know java or any programming language 

we can't write any java login on html page ,  none of variable or any kind of java logic will work in
html file. 


then how to write java stuff on html file? 

for this they introduce JSP. 
java server pages / java servlet pages 

so now we are going to create jsp file instead of html file 

jsp => html + java 

jsp supports both html and java so we can write html stuff as well as java stuff on JSP page. 

by default jsp accept HTML , if you want to write java stuff  you have to add some notations 

1)scriptlet <% %> 
2)expression <%= %>
3)declaration <%! %> 


scriptlet is used to write java code -- any java code 
expression is used to print java variable -- any variable within the scope 
declaration is used to declare  instance variable


JSP has 9 implicit objects-->
------------------------------------------------------------

filter 

1) class implements Filter 
2) override -> filter -> logic 
3) web.xml mapping | annotation 


client => request ==>   server => Filter |  {servlet} 

AddProduct -> validation 


EL -> expression language
